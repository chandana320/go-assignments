# go-assignments
 There are files like  main1.go and sport.go in sport directory. The main1.go  is the driver package and sport is where the logic is.It is assignment-1. Remaining assignment is in main.go and I have created a Make file and also for testing I have created sport1.go and sport1_test.go
